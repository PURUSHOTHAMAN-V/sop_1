# Rewards System - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Retreivo Rewards System incentivizes community participation by rewarding users when their lost items are found and verified, or when they help return found items to their owners.

## 🎯 Reward Flow Implementation

### **Core Reward Logic:**

#### 1. **Lost Item Reporter Rewards (50 points)**
- **Trigger**: When a lost item is claimed and verified by the hub
- **Recipient**: Original person who reported the item as lost
- **Message**: `🎉 Your lost item "{itemName}" has been found and verified! Thank you for reporting it and helping others.`
- **Purpose**: Encourages users to report lost items, helping create a comprehensive database

#### 2. **Found Item Returner Rewards (100 points)**
- **Trigger**: When a found item claim is approved by the hub
- **Recipient**: Person who found and returned the item
- **Message**: `🎉 Found item "{itemName}" successfully claimed and verified! You helped reunite someone with their lost item.`
- **Purpose**: Rewards good samaritans who help return lost items

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Backend (Node.js/Express)**

#### Database Schema:
```sql
-- Users table with rewards balance
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rewards_balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    -- other fields...
);

-- Rewards tracking table
CREATE TABLE rewards (
    reward_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
    reason VARCHAR(255),
    item_id INTEGER,
    item_type VARCHAR(10),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/user/rewards` - Fetch user's rewards balance and history
- `PUT /api/hub/claim/:id/approve` - Approves claim and triggers rewards

#### Reward Award Logic:
```javascript
// For found item claims (100 points to finder)
if (claim.item_type === 'found') {
  const rewardAmount = 100;
  await client.query('UPDATE users SET rewards_balance = rewards_balance + $1 WHERE user_id = $2', [rewardAmount, finderUserId]);
  await client.query('INSERT INTO rewards(user_id, amount, reason, item_id, item_type) VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)', 
    [finderUserId, rewardAmount, `🎉 Found item "${itemName}" successfully claimed and verified! You helped reunite someone with their lost item.`, claim.item_id, 'found']);
}

// For lost item claims (50 points to original reporter)
else if (claim.item_type === 'lost') {
  const rewardAmount = 50;
  await client.query('UPDATE users SET rewards_balance = rewards_balance + $1 WHERE user_id = $2', [rewardAmount, reporterUserId]);
  await client.query('INSERT INTO rewards(user_id, amount, reason, item_id, item_type) VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)', 
    [reporterUserId, rewardAmount, `🎉 Your lost item "${itemName}" has been found and verified! Thank you for reporting it and helping others.`, claim.item_id, 'lost']);
}
```
